Sign into Figma using IBM SSO\n\nYou should be added to the IBM Figma organization automatically once you sign\nin. You do not need to join or request to join any specific team to access the\nlibraries.\n\n#### 2. Turn on the theme libraries\n\nThere are four Carbon themes, two light (White and Gray 10) and two dark (Gray\n90 and Gray 100). Each theme lives in its own Figma library. You can turn on as\nmany libraries as you’d like.\n\nInside of a design file, navigate to the **Main menu** panel in the top left of\nthe toolbar (A). Open the menu and select **Libraries** from the list (B).\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![figma instructions part 1](images/kit-figma-1.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\nThen in the Libraries modal that appears, find the team called\n`[NEW] IBM Design Systems` (C) and switch the toggle beside a themed library,\nfor example the `White theme - Carbon Design System` to on (D).\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![figma instructions part 2](images/kit-figma-2.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n<br />\n<br />\n\nTo preview the four Carbon themes, visit these view-only links.\n\n<Row className=\"resource-card-group\">\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={4} noGutterSm>\n  <ResourceCard\n    onClick={() => fathom.trackGoal('P0OEN9TS', 0)}\n    subTitle=\"White theme\"\n    href=\"https://www.figma.com/file/Vzz8k68Pqk5HfaTdQOQrGu/White-Theme---Carbon-Design-System\"\n    actionIcon=\"launch\">\n\n![Figma icon](/images/figma.svg)\n\n  </ResourceCard>\n</Column>\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={4} noGutterSm>\n  <ResourceCard\n    onClick={() => fathom.trackGoal('T7D1HJ3L', 0)}\n    subTitle=\"Gray 10 theme\"\n    href=\"https://www.figma.com/file/i6y80WeotmhmbWxpmcffz7/Gray-10-Theme---Carbon-Design-System\"\n    actionIcon=\"launch\">\n\n![Figma icon](/images/figma.svg)\n\n  </ResourceCard>\n</Column>\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={4} noGutterSm>\n  <ResourceCard\n    onClick={() => fathom.trackGoal('LYFJTPDE', 0)}\n    subTitle=\"Gray 90 theme\"\n    href=\"https://www.figma.com/file/fCucrHE8tdGDVJX7ODqajd/Gray-90-Theme---Carbon-Design-System\"\n    actionIcon=\"launch\">\n\n![Figma icon](/images/figma.svg)\n\n  </ResourceCard>\n</Column>\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={4} noGutterSm>\n  <ResourceCard\n    onClick={() => fathom.trackGoal('3XH0SIBJ', 0)}\n    subTitle=\"Gray 100 theme\"\n    href=\"https://www.figma.com/file/TckQzGe3bNxHPLoRhbXFal/Gray-100-Theme---Carbon-Design-System\"\n    actionIcon=\"launch\">\n\n![Figma icon](/images/figma.svg)\n\n  </ResourceCard>\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n<br />\n\n#### 3. Turn on the other IBM Design Language libraries \n\nUnder the same team `[NEW] IBM Design Systems` you can also turn on the\nfollowing libraries:\n\n- Color styles - IBM Design Language\n- Text styles - IBM Design Language\n- Icons - IBM Design Language\n- Pictograms - IBM Design Language\n\n## Start designing\n\n### Components\n\nIncluded in the library are all 32 of the Carbon components and their variants.\nTo insert a component, go to the **Asset** panel and find the component you\nwould like to use. Drag it from the asset panel onto the canvas.\n\nView the name of the component in the right sidebar. If the component has\nvariants, you'll see fields underneath the component name to configure the\nproperties and values of that component set.\n\nFor more help on how to use Figma components, see the\n[Figma docs](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360056440594-Create-and-use-variants#Use_variants).\n\n### Grids and Screens\n\nIncluded in the library is an asset called `Screens`. These screens provide a\ncanvas that can be configured at the five 2x grid breakpoints. It also includes\nthe 16 column grid both with and without a left panel grid influencer.\n\n### Color styles\n\nThe Carbon color tokens are surfaced in Figma using styles. To apply a color\nstyle, select an object then in the **Styles** menu you can select a style from\nthe Carbon theme libraries or the IBM Design Language libraries. In addition to\napplying color styles to objects, you can also apply Color Styles to Text\nlayers.\n\nTo learn more about applying color styles in Figma, see the\n[Figma docs](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040316193).\n\n### Text styles\n\nTo apply a text style, select a text layer then in the properties panel select\nthe text style from the `Text styles - IBM Design Language` library. Use color\nstyles to change the color of a text style.\n\nTo learn more about applying text styles in Figma, see the\n[Figma docs](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039957034-Create-and-Apply-Text-Styles#apply).\n\n## Feedback\n\nHelp us improve this component by providing feedback, asking questions, and\nleaving any other comments on\n[GitHub](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-design-kit/issues).\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"83f53f4d5cc8ba834fa974f69a739b83","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":4007},"frontmatter":{"title":"Design kits","description":"Rapidly build beautiful and accessible experiences.
